        Sometimes, air pollution is visible. A person can see dark smoke pour from the exhaust pipes of large trucks or factories, for example. More often, however, air pollution is invisible.

Polluted air can be dangerous, even if the pollutants are invisible. It can make peopleâ€™s eyes burn and make them have difficulty breathing. It can also increase the risk of lung cancer.

Sometimes, air pollution kills quickly. In 1984, an accident at a pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, released a deadly gas into the air. At least 8,000 people died within days. Hundreds of thousands more were permanently injured.
